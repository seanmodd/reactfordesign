# Getting Started
Each of these lessons use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

To start the project yourself:
1. Run `npm install` in each project to install the node modules.
2. Run `npm start` to start the create-react-app development server
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000`
